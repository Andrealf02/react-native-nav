In human-centered design, when we speak about a modal (or modality), we often refer to a set of techniques, aimed at bringing user attention to a specific event / screen / action / etc. Those often require user input. A pop-up on a website, a file deletion confirmation dialogue on your computer, or an alert asking you to enable location service on your phone - these can all be considered modals.

A modal is a term used in native iOS world ([full description here](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/modality/)), while on Android, [dialogs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs) are often used to create similar or identical behavior, alongside other techniques.

## Presenting modals

Modal can be displayed by invoking the `Navigation.showModal()` command, as shown in the example below:

```js
Navigation.showModal({
  stack: {
    children: [
      {
        component: {
          name: 'MODAL_SCREEN',
          options: {
            topBar: {
              title: {
                text: 'Modal',
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```
Or by declaring modal as a Component inside render function:

:::note
Available for Android only, for iOS please use Modal from `react-native`.
:::

([Full code can be found in the Playground](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/blob/master/playground/src/screens/ModalScreen.tsx)).

```jsx
import { NavigationComponent, Modal as RNNModal } from 'react-native-navigation';
.....
toggleModal = () => this.setState({ modalVisible: !this.state.modalVisible });
.....
render() {
  return (
    .....
  <RNNModal
      onShow={/* optional callback */}
      animationType={/* optional, 'none' | 'fade' | 'slide', default 'slide'*/}
      blurOnUnmount={/* optional, default false */}
      transparent={/* optional, default false, true behaves as overCurrentContext */}
      visible={this.state.modalVisible}
      onRequestClose={() => this.setState({ modalVisible: false })}
      >
          <Button
            label="Dismiss declared Modal"
            testID={DISMISS_MODAL_BTN}
            onPress={this.toggleModal}
          />
          ....
    </RNNModal>
    ....
    );
}
```

Here's how the Modal looks on both platforms.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ios"
  values={[
    { label: 'iOS', value: 'ios' },
    { label: 'Android', value: 'android' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="ios">
    <img width="40%" src={useBaseUrl('img/modal_ios.gif')} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android">
    <img width="40%" src={useBaseUrl('img/modal_android.gif')} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Adding a dismiss button

Modals should always have a dismiss button, on left-to-right devices it's typically placed as a left button in the TopBar.

After we've added our dismiss button, we need to dismiss the modal when the button is pressed.

:::note
For the LeftButton to be visible, the screen must be displayed in a Stack.
:::

```js
class ModalScreen extends React.Component {
  // Set a dismiss button in static options
  static options() {
    return {
      topBar: {
        leftButtons: {
          id: 'dismiss',
          icon: require('./dismiss.png'),
        },
      },
    };
  }

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Register to events
    Navigation.events().bindComponent(this);
  }

  // Handle the button press event and dismiss the modal if needed
  navigationButtonPressed({ buttonId }) {
    if (buttonId === 'dismiss') {
      Navigation.dismissModal(this.props.componentId);
    }
  }
}
```

## Transparent modals

Showing transparent modals is a nice technique to increase immersiveness while keeping the user in the same context.
When a modal is displayed the content behind it (either root or modal) is removed from hierarchy. While this behavior improves performance, it's undesired when
showing transparent modals as we need to see the content behind it.

To configure this behaviour, we'll need to change the `modalPresentationStyle` option to `overCurrentContext` and change the layout background color to `'transparent'`.

```js
{
  modalPresentationStyle: 'overCurrentContext',
  layout: {
    backgroundColor: 'transparent'
  }
}
```

## Preventing a Modal from being dismissed

Preventing a modal from being dismissed is done differently for each platform. While preventing the user from dismissing the modal is possible,
the modal could still be dismissed programmatically by calling `Navigation.dismissModal()`

If the modal has a dismiss button, of course you'll need to handle it your self and avoid calling `Navigation.dismissModal()`
when the button is pressed.

### Android

On Android, modals can be dismissed with the hardware back button. You can handle the back press yourself by
disabling the hardware back button `dismissModalOnPress` option:

```js
{
  hardwareBackButton: {
    dismissModalOnPress: false;
  }
}
```

As a result, pressing the hardware back button will not dismiss the modal and will dispatch [`navigationButtonPress`](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/api/events#navigationbuttonpressed-event) event with the default hardware back button id `RNN.hardwareBackButton`.

### iOS

While iOS devices don't have a hardware back button, PageSheet modals can be dismissed by swipe gesture
from the top of the screen. To disable it, set [swipeToDismiss](#) option to false.

## Presentation Style

The [presentation style](/react-native-navigation/api/options-root#modalpresentationstyle) determines the look and feel of a screen displayed as modal.
