React Native Navigation is a module, dependent on and intended to be used alongside [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), so some experience with it and knowledge of core concepts is required. If you feel the need, you can start with their [getting started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) tutorial, and then come back here when you're ready.

We also assume you are working on a Mac with XCode and Android Studio installed and setup. You can also make it work in a Linux distribution, of course, but in that case bear in mind that some sections of the docs that deal with iOS might not be relevant to you.

If you want to dig right into it, start with [installing](docs-Installing.mdx) the library. If you're just looking around, we suggest checking out [basic navigation](docs-basic-navigation.mdx) first.
