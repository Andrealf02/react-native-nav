### Running The Project

If you want to have a quick look around and test things out, you can run the playground app, bundled with this repo.

1. Install dependencies via `npm install` (if you haven't already) and `npm run pod-install` (for iOS)
2. Run the playground project on Android and iOS
    - `npm run start` to get the packager running in the terminal, leave it open
    - **iOS**: open `./playground/ios` in Xcode and run it
    - **Android**: open `./playground/android` in Android Studio and run it
3. You can run tests if / when you need to (list of scripts [available here](meta-contributing#scripts)). Before
you start changing things, make sure everything works.
	- To easily run all tests in parallel `npm run test-all`
