## Initial props

React components use [props](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props) to receive data when they are created. When displaying the [component](../api/layout-component) layout, you can pass initial props to components using the `passProps` property.

In this example, we push the `UserProfile` screen and pass two initial props to it:

```js
Navigation.push(this.props.componentId, {
  component: {
    name: 'UserProfile',
    id: 'PROFILE_SCREEN_ID'
    passProps: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      status: 'online'
    }
  }
});
```

:::tip Serialization
passProps don't need to be serializable. You can use this mechanism to pass lambda functions or even React Components.

## Handling passProps in static options

Each component can have a static options property which is used to configure the style properties of elements on the screen when that component is displayed. 

Static options can either be a simple object, or a function which accepts `passProps` as an argument. Sometimes when declaring components, not all style properties are known. For example, a user profile screen will usually have the user's name as the TopBar title text. Therefore the title must be configured dynamically when pushing the screen.

Following the code example [above](passing-data-to-components#initial-props), lets see how to use props passed in the push command to set the TopBar title.

```jsx
class UserProfileScreen extends React.Component {
  static options(props) {
    return {
      topBar: {
        title: {
          text: props.name
        }
      }
    };
  }
}
```

## Updating props

To update a component's props, use the [Navigation.updateProps()](../api/component#updateprops) command. Updating props triggers the component lifecycle methods related to [updating](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#updating).

Notice that we're using the component `id` in order to update props of this specific instance of the component.

```js
Navigation.updateProps('PROFILE_SCREEN_ID', {
  status: 'offline'
});
```
